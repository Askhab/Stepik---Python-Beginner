#  Ramanujan numbers
# Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician who was famous for his intuition about numbers. When the English mathematician Godfrey Hardy visited him one day in the hospital, he mentioned that the number of the taxi in which he arrived was 17291729, such a boring and ordinary number. To which Ramanujan replied, "No, no! It's a very interesting number. It's the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways." In other words
# 1729 = (1 ** 3) + (12 ** 3) = (9 ** 3) + (10 ** 3)
# Write a program that finds similar interesting numbers. In your answer, write down the first 5 numbers in ascending order, including the number 1729.
# NOTE. Use nested loop.
