# NUMBER SYSTEMS

# The number system is a symbolic method of writing numbers, that is, the representation of numbers using written characters.

# number - some abstract entity, a measure for describing the amount of something;
# digit is a character used to write numbers.
# The numbers are different, and the most common are Arabic numerals, represented by characters from zero (0) (0) to nine (9) (9); Roman numerals are less common, they can be found on the watch dial or in the designation of the century (XIX century).

# Since there are many more numbers than digits, a set of digits is usually used to write a number. Only for the smallest integers, one digit is sufficient.

# There are many ways to write numbers using numerals, called number systems. The value of the number may or may not depend on the order of the digits in the entry. All number systems can be divided into 44 main groups:

# unary;
# positional;
# non-positional;
# mixed.


# UNARY NUMBER SYSTEMS

# In ancient times, when people began to count, there was a need to write down numbers. The number of objects was represented by dashes or notches on some solid surface: stone, wood, clay. Later, the icons began to be grouped in threes or fives. Such a system of writing numbers is called unary (single), since any number in it is formed by repeating one character, symbolizing the unit. Echoes of the unary number system are still found today (counting sticks for teaching counting; stripes sewn on the sleeve and indicating which course the cadet of the military school is studying).


# POSITIOONAL NUMBER SYSTEMS

# В позиционных системах счисления значение цифры зависит от ее положения — позиции — в числе.
#
# Например, число 1515 обозначает пятнадцать, 5151 — пятьдесят один.
#
# Позиционные системы счисления позволяют легко производить арифметические расчеты.
#
# Представление чисел с помощью арабских цифр — самая распространенная позиционная система счисления, она называется десятичной системой счисления потому, что использует десять цифр: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 80,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 и 99.
# In positional number systems, the value of a digit depends on its position - position - in the number.
#
# For example, the number 1515 means fifteen, 5151 means fifty-one.
#
# Positional number systems make it easy to perform arithmetic calculations.
#
# Representing numbers using Arabic numerals is the most common positional number system, it is called the decimal number system because it uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 80,1,2,3,4 ,5,6,7,8 and 99.

# REMEMBER: the maximum digit (9) is one less than the number of digits (10).

# The number of digits used in a number system is called its base. Base ten in decimal, two in binary, and eight and sixteen in octal and hexadecimal, respectively.

# REMEMBER:  when using non-positional number systems, it is very difficult to perform mathematical calculations and a large number of different signs are needed to write numbers, especially large ones.


# MIXED NUMBER SYSTEMS

# Mixed number systems are when numbers given in a number system with base pp are depicted using digits of another system, with base qq, where q < pq < p. Such a system is called q-pq−p-ary with major base pp and minor base qq.

# Banknotes are an example of a mixed number system. Now in Russia coins and banknotes of the following denominations are used: 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 50001,2,5,10,50,100,200,500,1000,2000,5000 rubles and 5 , 10, 505.10.50 kopecks. To get a certain amount in rubles, you need to use a certain amount of banknotes of various denominations. Thus, this system has a number of bases, equal to the denominations of banknotes, the base of the system with which they are counted is also used.


# NOTES:

# NOTE 1. The Roman number system is non-positional, it uses letters of the Latin alphabet to write numbers:

# I - means "one" (1);
# V - means "five" (5);
# X means "ten" (10);
# L - means "fifty" (50);
# C - means "one hundred" (100);
# D - means "five hundred" (500);
# M stands for "one thousand" (1000).

# There are two rules for writing numbers in the Roman system:
# - each smaller sign placed to the left of the larger one is subtracted from it;
# - each smaller sign placed to the right of the larger one is added to it.

# Examples:
# - the number 49 in the Roman numeral system has the form XLIX=(50-10)+(10-1)=40+9 (two groups of the first type).
# - the number 444 in the Roman numeral system will be written as CDXLIV=(500-100)+(50-10)+(5-1)=400+40+4 (three
# groups of the second kind).

# The Roman numeral system is used today mainly to designate significant and anniversaries, sections and chapters in books.
#
# NOTE 2. The most commonly used positional systems are:
#
# 1 - single (counting on the fingers, notches, etc.);
# 2 - binary (in discrete mathematics, computer science, programming);
# 8 - octal;
# 10 - decimal (used everywhere);
# 12 - duodecimal (counting by dozens);
# 16 - hexadecimal (used in programming, computer science).

# NOTE 3. The first positional number system was invented in Ancient Babylon, and the Babylonian numbering was sexagesimal, i.e. it used sixty digits. We still count, an hour is 60 minutes, a minute is 60 seconds, a circle is 360∘

# NOTE 4. To designate numbers in number systems with a base greater than 1010, the letters of the English alphabet are traditionally used - 10 = A, 11 = B, 12 = C, and so on.


# Converting numbers from any number system to decimal

# We use the folded form of a number, but we know that, for example, a decimal number
# 352 = 3 * 100 + 5 * 10 + 2.

# In expanded form, the digits of the number are multiplied by the degree of the base, i.e.
# 352 = 3 * (10 ** 2) + 5 * (10 ** 1) + 2 * (10 ** 0)

# That is, any number in the positional number system can be written in expanded form and converted to the decimal number system.


# EXAMPLES:

# Example 1. Convert binary number 110101 to the decimal number system.

# Solution. Let's number the digits of the binary number from right to left starting from zero 1[5]1[4]0[3]1[2]0[1]1[0]
# 110101 = 1 * (2 ** 5) + 1 * (2 ** 4) + 0 * (2 ** 3) + 1 * (2 ** 2) + 0 * (2 ** 1) + 1 (2 ** 0) = 53

# NOTE: In computer memory, numbers are represented in the binary system, so in computer science it often becomes necessary to convert numbers from binary to decimal and vice versa.


# Example 2. Convert a number from the quaternary number system 3211 - to the decimal number system.

# Solution. We number the digits of a quaternary number from right to left starting from zero 3[3]2[2]1[1]1[0].We have:
# 3211 = 3 * (4 ** 3) + 2 * (4 ** 2) + 1 * (4 ** 1) + 1 * (4 ** 0) = 3 * 64 + 2 * 16 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 1 = 229


# Example 3. Convert number from octal number system 214 to the decimal number system.

# Solution. Let's number the digits of the octal number from right to left starting from zero 2[2]1[1]4[0] . We have:
# 214 = 2 * (8 ** 2) + 1 * (8 ** 1) + 4 * (8 ** 0) = 128 + 8 + 4 = 140


# Example 4. Convert a number from the hexadecimal number system 2AF to the decimal number system.

# Solution. Let's number the digits of the hexadecimal number from right to left starting from zero 2[2]A[1]F[0]
# 2AF = 2 * (16 ** 2) + 10 * (16 ** 1) + 15 * (16 ** 0) = 687

# NOTE: In hexadecimal notation A=10 and F=15.
# 1AF2
# 2 + 31 + 2816 + 4096


# CONVERTING NUMBERS FROM THE DECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM TO ANY ANOTHER

# To convert numbers from the decimal number system to any other, use the following algorithm:

# - we divide the given number by the base of the new number system and fix the integer quotient and the remainder of  the division (the remainder is always less than the base);
# - if the resulting quotient is greater than the base, then we divide the quotient by the base and again fix the new quotient and the remainder of the division;
# - we repeat this process until the quotient is less than the divisor, that is, the base of the new number system;
# - the resulting remainders, which are the digits of a number in the new number system, are brought into line with its alphabet;
# - write the last quotient and the resulting remainders in reverse order in a row from left to right.

# EXAMPLES:
# Example 1. Convert decimal number 25 to the binary number system.

# Solution. In accordance with the algorithm, we get:
# 25 % 2 = 1  -  (25 - 1) / 2 = 12
# 12 % 2 = 0  -  (12 - 0) / 2 = 6
# 6 % 2 = 0  -  (6 - 0) / 2 = 3
# 3 % 2 = 1  -  (3 - 1) / 2 = 1 (last digit)
# 25 (decimal) == 11001 (binary)


# Example 2. Convert decimal number 125 to the octal number system.

# Solution. In accordance with the algorithm, we get:
# 125 % 8 = 5   -   (125 - 5) / 8 = 15
# 15 % 8 = 7    -   (15 - 7) / 8 = 1 (last digit)
# 125 (decimal) == 175 (octal)


# Example 3. Convert decimal number 428 to hexadecimal number system.

# Solution. Since in the hexadecimal number system A = 10, C = 12 then in accordance with the algorithm we get:
# 428 % 16 = 12   -   (428 - 12) / 16 = 26
# 26 % 16 = 10    -   (26 - 10) / 16 = 1 (last digit)
# 428 (decimal) = 1AC (hexadecimal)


# BINARY, OCTAL AND HEXADECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEMS

# In computer science and programming, binary, octal, and hexadecimal number systems are often used. Python has three built-in functions bin(), oct(), hex() that return string representations of an integer decimal number in the corresponding number system (2, \, 8, \, 16)(2,8,16).


# bin() - FUNCTION
# The bin() function returns a string with the binary representation of the specified integer.
#
# The following program code:
# print(bin(10))
# print(bin(128))
# print(bin(150))
# print(bin(18765))

# outputs:
# 0b1010
# 0b10000000
# 0b10010110
# 0b100100101001101

# Important: pay attention to the prefix 0b, which indicates that the number is represented in the binary number system.


# oct() - FUNCTION
# The oct() function returns a string with the octal representation of the specified integer.

# The following program code:
# print(oct(10))
# print(oct(128))
# print(oct(150))
# print(oct(18765))

# outputs:
# 0o12
# 0o200
# 0o226
# 0o44515

# Important: pay attention to the prefix 0o, which indicates that the number is represented in the octal number system.


# hex() - FUNCTION
# The hex() function returns a string with the hexadecimal representation of the specified integer.

# The following program code:
# print(hex(10))
# print(hex(128))
# print(hex(150))
# print(hex(18765))

# outputs:
# 0xa
# 0x80
# 0x96
# 0x494d

# Important: pay attention to the prefix 0x, which indicates that the number is represented in hexadecimal.


# NOTES:
# Note 1. If we need to get rid of the prefixes 0b, 0o, 0x, then we can use a string slice:

# num = 127
# bin_num = bin(num) # 0b1111111
# oct_num = oct(num) # 0o177
# hex_num = hex(num) # 0x7f

# print(bin_num[2:]) # 1111111
# print(oct_num[2:]) # 177
# print(hex_num[2:]) # 7f


# Note 2: Please note that the hex() function returns a hexadecimal number with small characters a, b, c, d, e, f. To convert to uppercase, you can use the upper() string method:

# num = 127432

# hex_num = hex(num) # 0x1f1c8
# print(hex_num[2:].upper()) # 1F1C8
